        <h2>Our Customer Reviews</h2>
         <p>John H: I downsized my home and wanted to sell my old gaming systems at a fair price.
            This company offered me the best deal and explained why the valued the items as they did. 
            The transaction was swift and easy! I would defiantly recommend them to others for future purchases or sales.</p>
         <p>Eric S: Looking to create the perfect man cave and  stopped by this store to see what the offered.
            It was a one stop shop and the customer service and warrantee offered made it a no brainer to purchase my arcade and gaming system here.
            I have no regrets the offered detailed installation instructions.</p>
         <p>Lindsey C: I knew nothing about the old entertainment system my boyfriend wanted for his birthday.
            I was leery about purchasing a expensive system with no  knowledge of what I was buying.
            However, the associate Karen put my mind at ease and offered me a great deal.
            I would recommend this store for any of their gaming entertainment needs.</p>
